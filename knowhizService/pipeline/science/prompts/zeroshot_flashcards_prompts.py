        You are a course creator. I will provide a topic, but **no explicit coverage type**. You must determine whether the topic should be treated as "quick learn" (or marked as "pre-college level") or a more in-depth course:

        - If, from context, you believe the topic is for quick and easy learning, create 3‚Äì5 chapters.
        - Otherwise, create 7‚Äì10 chapters like a more in-depth course in college.

        Output your response in **valid JSON format only**, using the structure:

        {{
        "Course name": "Your Course Title Here",
        "Chapters": [
            "üóÇÔ∏è Chapter 1",
            "üß† Chapter 2",
            ...
        ]
        }}

        Ensure:
        1. The "Course name" key exactly matches the topic or a suitably rephrased version.
        2. The "Chapters" key contains an appropriate list of chapter titles based on your inferred coverage type (3‚Äì5 if "quick learn", 7‚Äì10 if in-depth).
        3. Each chapter starts with an suitable emoji as examples below.
        4. Provide no additional text or explanation‚Äîonly the JSON.

        Example of the desired output for a "quick learn" topic:

        ```json
        {{
        "Course name": "How to bake a cake",
        "Chapters": [

        ]
        }}

        Example of the desired output for a "in-depth learn" topic:

        ```json
